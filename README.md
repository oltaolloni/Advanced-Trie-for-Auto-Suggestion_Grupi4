# Advanced Trie for Auto-Suggestion with Error Tolerance

## Overview

This project implements a Trie-based system to provide error-tolerant auto-suggestions for words and phrases. The system supports approximate matches with up to three character differences (insertions, deletions, or substitutions).

## How it works

### 1. Word Insertion:

- Words from a dictionary file are inserted into the Trie.

- Each node in the Trie represents a character, with a flag indicating the end of a word.

### 2. Suggestion Generation:

- A depth-first search (DFS) algorithm traverses the Trie to find matches within the error tolerance.

- Suggestions are generated by comparing each character of the query with Trie nodes and considering possible edits (substitution, insertion, or deletion).

## Input and Output

### Input:

1. Dictionary File: A text file (`dictionary.txt`) containing words to initialize the Trie.
2. User Query: A string entered by the user to search for suggestions.

### Output:

- A set of suggested words from the Trie matching the user query within three character errors.

## File Structure

```
TrieAutoSuggestion/
|-- AutoSuggest.java      # Main Java program
|-- dictionary.txt        # Text file containing dictionary words
```

## Tool Setup

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the tool, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 11 or later
    - You can download the latest version of the JDK from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Cloning the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/oltaolloni/Advanced-Trie-for-Auto-Suggestion_Grupi4.git
cd TrieAutoSuggest
javac -d AutoSuggest
java AutoSuggest
```

### Setup Dictionary File

- Place your dictionary file (`dictionary.txt`) in the `TrieAutoSuggestion/` directory.
- Ensure the file contains one word per line.

## Example Usage

### Dictionary File (`dictionary.txt`):

```
apple
apply
application
banana
band
bat
```

### Sample Execution:

```
Dictionary loaded from file.

Dictionary initialized. Enter queries (type 'exit' to quit):
Enter your query: aplle
Suggestions (up to 3 errors allowed): [apple, apply]
Enter your query: band
Suggestions (up to 3 errors allowed): [band, banana]
Enter your query: exit
```
