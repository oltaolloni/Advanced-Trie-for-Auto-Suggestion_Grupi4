# Advanced Trie for Auto-Suggestion with Error Tolerance

## Problem Description: Implement a Trie that offers error-tolerant auto-suggestions for words and phrases. It should account for up to three character substitutions, deletions, or insertions.

### Requirements:
1. Use Trie for word storage.
2. Allow approximate matches with error tolerance.

### Algorithm: Construct a Trie with an error-tolerant search algorithm using DFS.

### Input: Dictionary and a user query.

### Output: Words that match within three-character tolerance.
